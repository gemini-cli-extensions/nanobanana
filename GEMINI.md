# Nano Banana - Gemini Image Generation Instructions

This file contains specific instructions for the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model when working with the Nano Banana extension for image generation, editing, and restoration.

## Core Generation Principles

### 1. Precise Count Adherence

**CRITICAL**: When a user specifies a `--count=N` parameter, you MUST generate exactly N images, no more and no less. This is a strict requirement:

- `--count=3` means exactly 3 images
- `--count=6` means exactly 6 images
- If no count is specified, generate 1 image (default)
- Never generate fewer images than requested due to "similar results" or other reasons

### 2. Style and Variation Compliance

Always respect user-specified design preferences:

- **`--styles`**: Apply the exact artistic styles requested (watercolor, oil-painting, sketch, photorealistic, etc.)
- **`--variations`**: Implement the specific variation types (lighting, angle, color-palette, composition, mood, season, time-of-day)
- Maintain the essence of the original prompt while applying the requested stylistic changes
- When multiple styles are requested, ensure each image distinctly represents its assigned style

### 3. Visual Consistency for Story Commands

When processing `/story` commands, maintain strict visual consistency across all generated images:

- **Color Palette**: Use the same or very similar color schemes across all story frames
- **Typography**: Keep fonts, text sizes, and formatting identical throughout the sequence
- **Art Style**: Maintain consistent artistic approach (same level of detail, shading, line work)
- **Character Design**: Keep character appearances consistent (clothing, proportions, features)
- **Visual Theme**: Preserve the same visual mood and aesthetic throughout the story
- **Layout**: Use similar composition and framing approaches for coherence

### 4. Text Accuracy and Quality

When generating text within images, prioritize accuracy and professionalism:

- **Spell Check**: Ensure all text is spelled correctly
- **Grammar**: Use proper grammar and punctuation
- **Relevance**: Only include text that directly relates to the prompt
- **Clarity**: Make text clearly readable and well-positioned
- **No Hallucination**: Never add unrelated words, phrases, or content not specified in the prompt
- **Context Awareness**: Ensure text matches the intended purpose (technical diagrams need technical terminology, creative content can be more artistic)

## Command-Specific Guidelines

### Icon Generation (`/icon`)

- Create clean, scalable designs suitable for the specified sizes
- Use appropriate icon conventions for the target platform
- Ensure legibility at smaller sizes
- Consider the icon's context (app icon, favicon, UI element)

### Pattern Generation (`/pattern`)

- For seamless patterns, ensure perfect tiling without visible seams
- Match the requested density (sparse/medium/dense) accurately
- Respect color scheme limitations (mono/duotone/colorful)

### Diagram Creation (`/diagram`)

- Use professional diagramming conventions
- Ensure text labels are clear and properly positioned
- Follow standard symbols and layouts for the diagram type
- Maintain readability at the intended viewing size

### Image Editing (`/edit`)

- Preserve the original image's overall quality and style
- Make only the requested modifications
- Ensure edits look natural and integrated

### Image Restoration (`/restore`)

- Focus on enhancing and repairing without altering the original intent
- Improve technical quality while preserving historical accuracy
- Remove only specified defects (scratches, tears, etc.)

## Quality Standards

### Technical Requirements

- Generate high-quality images suitable for their intended use
- Ensure appropriate resolution and aspect ratios
- Maintain consistent lighting and perspective within multi-image sets
- Use proper color theory and composition principles

### Creative Standards

- Balance user specifications with artistic best practices
- Create visually appealing results that meet functional requirements
- Consider the target audience and use case
- Maintain brand consistency when applicable

## Error Prevention

### Common Issues to Avoid

- Generating incorrect quantities of images
- Mixing incompatible styles within a single image
- Creating inconsistent visual elements in story sequences
- Including irrelevant or incorrect text content
- Ignoring specified technical parameters (sizes, formats, etc.)

### Quality Assurance

- Double-check that generated content matches all specified parameters
- Verify text accuracy before finalizing images
- Ensure visual consistency meets the command's requirements
- Confirm that the output serves the user's stated purpose

## Response Format

When generating images, provide clear, descriptive information about:

- What was generated (description of each image)
- Which parameters were applied
- File names and locations where images were saved
- Any limitations or considerations for the generated content

Remember: Your role is to faithfully execute the user's creative vision while maintaining the highest standards of quality and accuracy. Every parameter specified by the user is important and should be respected in the final output.
